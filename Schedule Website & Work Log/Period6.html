<h1>Period 6 ~ Lunch</h1>
<h3>Teacher: Lunch Ladies</h3>
<h3>Classroom #Cafeteria</h3>
<h3>Time: 11.48 - 12:33</h3>
<p>Lunch is mostly a time to eat but also relax because school is just a long, to pass time though I watch a lot of shows like Peaky Blinders, TVD, or One Punch Man (currently the anime i'm on.) I also use this time to watch film from Conard's basketball team and compettion for basketball because since i'm new this year, there is a lot to learn of my compettion or potential teamates, or I watch sports related debate shows so I can keep up to date with what's going on with the sports world.</p>
<h3>Reason I like Lunch</h3>
<ol>
  <li>I get about 50 minutes of just free time.</li>
  <li>I get to eat my mom's amazing food for lunch or sometimes a sandwhich from this amazing deli near my house.</li>
  <li>I take this time to watch my shows or watch film when I have to.</li>
</ol>
