<h1>Period 7 ~ Automotive Technology</h1>
<h3>Teacher: Mr. McDermott</h3>
<h3>Classroom #199</h3>
<h3>Time: 12:37 - 1:22</h3>
<p>In auto tech we are working on multiple things but mainly at the moment we are working on brakes.</p>
<h3>3 Reasons I like this class</h3>
<ol>
  <li>I've always loved cars and i'll always jump at the oppertunity to learn more about them.</li>
  <li>Everyday there is a new car so were always learning about multiple different cars.</li>
  <li>Mr.McDermott isn't a strict teacher, he encourages that it's ok to mess up and make mistakes cause that's the best way to learn.</li>
</ol>
