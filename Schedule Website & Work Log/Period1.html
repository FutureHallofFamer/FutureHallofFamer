<h1>Period 1 ~ Spanish 1</h1>
<h3>Teacher: Mr. Grudzien</h3>
<h3>Classroom #313</h3>
<h3>Time: 7:30 - 8:18</h3>
<p>Currently we are about to learn how to tell time after working on learning how to say common objects that are in classrooms.</p>
<h3>3 Reaseons I like this class</h3>
<ol>
  <li>I am Puerto Rican from both my parents side, but unlike my older brother and sister I was born in NY so my main language is english but I still knew spanish due to my whole family speaking it so I learned the basics but still don't know much to call myself a true Puerto Rican so this class helps me with that. </li>
  <li>Mr. Grudzien is a cool and funny teacher, he makes learning fun, easy and he makes a lot of jokes that aren't funny but make you laugh cause their just that bad.</li>
  <li>Since I know most of the basic spanish such as the numbers, alphebet, starting and ending quick converstaions and etc, it makes the class a little easier and helps me understand easier what Mr. Grudzien is talking about.</li>
