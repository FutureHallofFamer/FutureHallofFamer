<h1>Period 5 ~ Game Web & Design</h1>
<h3>Teacher: Mr. Rosa</h3>
<h3>Classroom #101</h3>
<h3>Time: 10:59 - 11:44</h3>
<p>Mr. Rosa has the class currently working on this project, making a website of our schedule.</p>
<h3>3 Reasons I like this Class</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Mr. Rosa is a Giants fan and I'm a Cowboys fan (Division Rivals) so it's fun to come in every monday and see him angry that his team basically is horrible and my team is amazing.</li>
  <li>When he assigns us work, he goes over every step on the board while we follow along so it makes the work 110% easier.</li>
  <li>He gives us more than enough time to get our work done and turn it in so it takes pressure off of me to finish quickly and sloppy.</li>
</ol>
