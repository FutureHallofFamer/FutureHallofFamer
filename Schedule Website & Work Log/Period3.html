<h1>Period 3 ~ English 10</h1>
<h3>Teacher: Mr. Stepensky</h3>
<h3>Classroom #203</h3>
<h3>Time: 9:18 - 10:06</h3></h1>
<p>Right now in Mr. Stepensky class we are reading "The Crucible"</p>
<h3>3 Reasons I like this Class</h3>
 <ol>
  <li>Mr. Stepensky is a very active teacher, you may think he has adhd but it's amazing cause when were reading he is always acting out the scene or he's running around the class to help people.</li>
  <li>He is very up to date with the new shows or movies that came out and he's always asking questions about them. Almost spoild Squid Games for me but were good.</li>
  <li>Everytime he takes attedance he has intresting quick questions to asnwer when he calls your name.</li>
</ol>
