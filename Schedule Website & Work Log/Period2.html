<h1>Period 2 ~ Algebra 1 (L2)</h1>
<h3>Teacher: Ms. Gocheva</h3>
<h3>Classroom #179</h3>
<h3>Time: 8:22 - 9:14</h3>
<p>We are currently working on learning how to solve absoulute value equations</p>
<h3>3 Reasons I like this class</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Main reason I like this class is that Ms. Gocheva lets me keep my airpods in as long as i'm listening to her and keeping up with the class.</li>
  <li>Ms. Gocheva is a laid back teacher, it's easy to ask her for help when you don't understand a problem, and she's a visual teacher and i'm a visual learner so it works.</li>
  <li>The atmosphere in the class is simple, it's second period so some people are still tired and ain't loud.</li>
</ol>
