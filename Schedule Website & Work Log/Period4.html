<h1>Period 4 ~ U.S History</h1>
<h3>Teacher: Ms. Lea</h3>
<h3>Classroom #141</h3>
<h3>Time: 10:10 - 10:55</h3></h1>
<p>In Ms. Lea class we are learning about the civil war and everything that happened after the Civil War ended.</p>
<h3>3 Reasons I like this class</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Ms. Lea work is probably the easiest out of all my other teachers.</li>
  <li>She gives us a kinda "cheat-cheat" on test that is very helpful for a grade that is important.</li>
  <li>At the end of class she gives us about 5 to 10 minutes to do homework</li>
</ol>
